## Key Changes in Third Revision

1. **Recurring Characters**: Sarah Chen (neuroscientist), Marcus Thompson (teacher/community builder), ARIA (AI system) appear in every chapter with developing arcs

2. **Narrative Focus**: Stories now comprise ~50% of content, making concepts more engaging and memorable

3. **Reorganized Structure**: Four parts organized around human development rather than AI concepts:
   - Part I: How we're formed
   - Part II: Our limitations
   - Part III: How we change
   - Part IV: Deep questions

4. **Central Theme**: "You are an algorithm that knows it's an algorithm" - reframing algorithmic nature as empowering rather than reductive

5. **Fewer, Deeper Chapters**: 12 chapters instead of 16 allows for richer exploration of each concept

## Key Changes in Fourth Revision (Review Pass)

1. **Research Citations**: Chapters 7-12 now include specific studies and researchers (Libet, Gollwitzer, Tononi, Ericsson, Woolley, etc.) matching the rigor of early chapters

2. **Marcus's Arc Earned**:
   - Added two failed forum rebuilds before success
   - Added Keisha as external bias-checker
   - Added self-awareness of his own role in original collapse
   - Added vulnerability and near-giving-up moments

3. **Character Depth**:
   - Sarah: divorce, insomnia, estranged sister, neglected violin, difficult reputation
   - Marcus: specific teaching focus, physical details, dishes ritual with Denise

4. **Consciousness Chapter Improved**:
   - Added empirical cases (blindsight, split-brain, locked-in syndrome)
   - Added novel philosophical contribution: consciousness as property of interactions
   - Added practical ethics under uncertainty

5. **Tone Grounded**: Removed inspirational overreach, added realistic caveats

6. **Structure Varied**: Chapters 9 and 11 open differently to reduce predictability

## Style/Tone

- Conversational but intellectually curious
- Concrete examples through character experiences
- Each technical concept illuminates human behavior
- Balance philosophy with practical application
- Characters make concepts relatable and memorable
