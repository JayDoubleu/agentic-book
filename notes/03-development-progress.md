## Key Changes in Third Revision

1. **Recurring Characters**: Sarah Chen (neuroscientist), Marcus Thompson (teacher/community builder), ARIA (AI system) appear in every chapter with developing arcs

2. **Narrative Focus**: Stories now comprise ~50% of content, making concepts more engaging and memorable

3. **Reorganized Structure**: Four parts organized around human development rather than AI concepts:
   - Part I: How we're formed
   - Part II: Our limitations
   - Part III: How we change
   - Part IV: Deep questions

4. **Central Theme**: "You are an algorithm that knows it's an algorithm" - reframing algorithmic nature as empowering rather than reductive

5. **Fewer, Deeper Chapters**: 12 chapters instead of 16 allows for richer exploration of each concept

## Style/Tone

- Conversational but intellectually curious
- Concrete examples through character experiences
- Each technical concept illuminates human behavior
- Balance philosophy with practical application
- Characters make concepts relatable and memorable
