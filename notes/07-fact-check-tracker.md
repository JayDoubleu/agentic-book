   - Accuracy of AI terminology and explanations
   - Correctness of technical parallels drawn
   - Validity of AI capability descriptions

2. **Research Citations & Studies**
   - Verification of mentioned research
   - Accuracy of study findings
   - Proper attribution of sources

3. **Statistical Claims**
   - Numerical data accuracy
   - Context and source verification
   - Currency of statistics

4. **Specific Examples & Case Studies**
   - Real-world accuracy of examples
   - Corporate/institutional references
   - Historical events or timelines
