# Second Draft Revision Plan

## Overview

Target: Expand from 36,233 to 50,000-55,000 words (+14-19k words)
Strategy: Deepen existing chapters rather than add new ones

## Priority 1: Address Major Issues

### 1.1 Fix Chapter 1-2 Redundancy

### 1.2 Expand Each Chapter (Target: 3,000-3,500 words each)

- Add 800-1,300 words per chapter
- Deepen opening scenes with more detail
- Add 2-3 more practical applications per chapter
- Include additional real-world examples
- Expand "What This Reveals" sections with research/studies

## Priority 2: Add Diverse Perspectives

### 2.1 Neurodivergent Perspectives

- Chapter 4 (Context Windows): Add ADHD perspective on attention
- Chapter 6 (Fine-Tuning): Include autism and routine formation
- Chapter 12 (Emergent Properties): Discuss savant abilities

### 2.2 Cultural Diversity

- Replace some Western-centric examples
- Add perspectives from collectivist cultures
- Include non-English language processing parallels

### 2.3 Age Diversity

- Chapter 10 (Overfitting): Elderly cognitive patterns
- Chapter 14 (Recursive Improvement): Lifelong learning

### 2.4 Socioeconomic Perspectives

- Include blue-collar workplace examples
- Add financial stress decision-making scenarios
- Discuss resource-constrained optimization

## Priority 3: Strengthen Transitions

### 3.1 Part Introductions (500 words each x 5 parts = 2,500 words)

- Part II: The boundaries of human processing
- Part III: The hidden forces shaping our thoughts
- Part IV: When our systems break down
- Part V: The biggest questions we face

### 3.2 Chapter Bridges

- Add concluding paragraph to each chapter previewing the next
- Create conceptual links between parts
- Reference earlier concepts when introducing new ones

## Priority 4: Expand Practical Applications

### 4.1 New Application Areas

- **Parenting**: Training young minds (Chapters 5, 6, 9)
- **Education**: Classroom as batch processing (Chapters 4, 10, 14)

- **Creative Work**: Generative processes (Chapters 3, 8, 12)
- **Mental Health**: Debugging the mind (Chapters 2, 10, 11)
- **Aging**: Cognitive maintenance (Chapters 4, 11, 14)

### 4.2 Deeper Examples

- Transform brief mentions into full scenarios
- Add dialogue and sensory details
- Include emotional stakes and outcomes

## Priority 5: Missing Concepts Integration

### 5.1 Attention Mechanisms

- Integrate into Chapter 4 (Context Windows)
- Human selective attention and focus
- Cocktail party effect as attention filtering

### 5.2 Transfer Learning

- Add to Chapter 9 (Training Data)
- How humans apply knowledge across domains
- Career changes and skill adaptation

### 5.3 Reinforcement Learning

- Weave into Chapter 6 (Fine-Tuning)
- Reward/punishment in habit formation
- Addiction as reinforcement gone wrong
