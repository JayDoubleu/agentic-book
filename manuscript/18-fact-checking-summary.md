# Fact-Checking Summary

*Added in response to reader feedback and as part of the book's commitment to transparency*

## Methodology

This fact-checking exercise was conducted using AI analysis (Gemini 2.5 Pro) to identify and verify factual claims throughout the book. Claims were categorized and verified against current scientific literature and established research.

## Key Findings

**Overall Accuracy**: 85% of factual claims are verified or well-supported by research
- ‚úÖ **Verified Claims**: 82 claims confirmed accurate
- üî¨ **Under Research**: 8 claims in active areas of investigation  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially True**: 6 claims with nuanced accuracy
- ‚ùå **Intentional Myths**: 7 debunked claims used for illustrative purposes

## Intentional Inaccuracies

Chapter 1 deliberately includes common myths to illustrate human "hallucination":
- "10% brain usage" myth (debunked)
- "Goldfish 3-second memory" myth (debunked)
- "Tongue map for taste" myth (debunked)
- Lightning/same place myth (debunked)
- Space pen vs. pencils story (oversimplified)

These serve the book's central argument about fact-checking double standards.

## High-Confidence Verified Claims

**AI/Technical Concepts** (100% accuracy):
- LLM parameters (temperature, context windows)
- AI grounding techniques (RAG, citation architecture)
- Machine learning concepts (overfitting, model collapse)
- AI alignment terminology

**Neuroscience/Psychology** (95% accuracy):
- Memory consolidation during sleep
- Neuroplasticity and brain development
- Trauma effects on brain structure
- Implicit bias research findings
- Attachment theory categories

**Documented Cases** (100% accuracy):
- Amazon AI hiring bias incident
- Healthcare algorithm bias (Obermeyer et al., 2019)
- Joy Buolamwini's facial recognition research
- Elizabeth Loftus false memory studies

## Areas Under Active Research

Some claims reflect ongoing scientific investigation:
- Epigenetic transmission of trauma
- Specific gender differences in cognition
- Exact mechanisms of meditation effects
- Autism/ADHD behavioral generalizations

## Verification Sources

Claims were cross-referenced against:
- Peer-reviewed scientific literature
- Established research institutions
- Documented historical incidents
- Technical AI/ML documentation

## Transparency Note

This fact-checking exercise fulfills the book's promise of "Future iterations will include AI-powered fact-checking." The high accuracy rate (85% verified) reflects the care taken in technical and scientific claims, while the intentional inclusion of myths serves the book's argumentative structure.
